# Coworking Agreement

Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.

## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*
We would like to feel comfortable to try new things together and be communicative throughout the process.


## Collaboration vs. individual work expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations- does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*
We will use live share to work collaboratively on our code, we want to read through the waves and understand the project independently, and will determine what sections we want to work together vs. independently on. 
## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*
Abby: I learn best when I have opportunity to try new things and make mistakes along the way. 
Kate: I learn best when I have some individual time to understand the project details before working collaboratively with a partner. 
## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*
Abby: I best receive feedback through casual conversation. 
Kate: I best receive feedback through casual conversation or comments in codes.

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*
Abby: Being able to talk about code and creating a clear plan to complete our project together :D
Kate: Being able to communicate code clearly so that partner understands.
## Optional: Other agreements
*Other co-working agreements that were not captured in the above sections.*
